# Image-Captioning-
This project builds an image captioning model using CNN and BiLSTM with attention. It extracts image features with VGG16 and generates captions by aligning visual and textual data using an attention mechanism. Trained on Flickr8k, it produces accurate, context-aware image descriptions.
